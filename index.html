    <h1>Nowhere by Tj Monterde</h1>
    <p>I wonder if you feel the same way I do<br>
    'Cause I don't like how I feel when I'm without you<br>
    I want you here<br>
    I want you near<br>
    There's no place I'd rather be<br><br>   
    'Cause my world turns gray when you're away<br>
    You paint my brightest hues<br>
    My world turns gray when you're away<br>
    Nowhere's a better place<br>
    Nowhere's a better place without you<br><br>
    I've been through a hundred crazy seasons<br>
    But with you I find every single reason<br>
    I want you here<br>
    Closer, my dear<br>
    There's no place I'd rather be (be)<br><br>
    'Cause my world turns gray (my world, turns gray) when you're away<br>
    You paint my brightest hues<br>
    My world turns gray (my world, turns gray) when you're away<br>
    Nowhere's a better place<br>
    Nowhere's a better place<br>
    Nowhere's a better place<br>
    Nowhere's a better place<br>
    Nowhere's a better place without you<br><br>
    With you by my side, I see the best of night<br>
    Like how the ocean shines beneath the moonlight<br>
    Nowhere's a better place<br>
    Nowhere's a better place when I'm without you<br>
